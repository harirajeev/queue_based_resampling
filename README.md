# Queue-Based Resampling (QBR)

## Description
Online class imbalance learning constitutes a new problem and an emerging research topic that focusses on the challenges of **online learning** under **class imbalance** and **concept drift**. Class imbalance deals with data streams that have very skewed distributions while concept drift deals with changes in the class imbalance status. Little work exists that addresses these challenges and in this paper we introduce **queue-based resampling** **(QBR)**, a novel algorithm that successfully addresses the co-existence of class imbalance and concept drift.
